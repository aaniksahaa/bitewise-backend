# BiteWise AI Assistant Project Description

## Project Overview

BiteWise is an innovative, AI-powered assistant designed to transform how users engage with food, nutrition, and healthy eating. By integrating advanced artificial intelligence with a user-centric interface, BiteWise delivers highly personalized dietary guidance, culinary inspiration, and a vibrant community experience. The platform emphasizes tailored nutrition tracking, recipe discovery, and social engagement, fostering a fun, hobby-driven approach to food while prioritizing individual health profiles.

## Objectives

- Provide a conversational AI chat interface that delivers personalized recommendations based on user-specific health and dietary data.
- Enable automated detection of ingredients and nutritional content from images, recipes, or text inputs.
- Offer a personalized food and calorie tracking system with a diary/timeline feature.
- Suggest recipes tailored to available ingredients and individual health needs.
- Create a community hub for sharing recipes, blogs, and maintaining food-focused fitness streaks.
- Deliver an exploratory platform for discovering new foods, cuisines, and recipes.
- Ensure a friendly, inclusive, and engaging user experience with food as a creative hobby.

## Key Features

### 1. Personalized Conversational AI Chat Interface

- Serves as the primary interaction point where users can ask about food, nutrition, or recipes.
- Prepends every LLM prompt with a user-specific context, including:
    - **Demographics**: Age, height, weight, sex.
    - **Health Profile**: Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), allergies (e.g., nuts, dairy), special health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), and fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).
    - **Preferences**: Taste preferences, cuisine interests, and cooking skill level.
- Extracts dietary preferences, calorie goals, and food intake details from natural language conversations.
- Delivers tailored advice, such as portion sizes, nutrient balancing, or allergy-safe alternatives, in a friendly tone.

### 2. Automated Ingredient and Nutrition Detection

- Uses computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to identify ingredients from:
    - Uploaded images (e.g., grocery hauls, dishes, or recipe cards).
    - Text inputs (e.g., typed recipes or ingredient lists).
- Calculates total calories and nutrient breakdown (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, fats) for meals or recipes, adjusted for user-specific health needs.
- Estimates portion sizes and ingredient measurements, ensuring compatibility with dietary restrictions or allergies.

### 3. Personalized Food Diary and Timeline

- Tracks daily food intake, calorie consumption, and nutrient distribution in a visually appealing timeline, customized to the user’s health profile.
- Displays historical trends, such as calorie deficits or excesses, aligned with personalized goals (e.g., weight management, balanced nutrition).
- Allows users to log meals manually or via chat, with AI auto-populating details from recognized inputs and flagging potential allergens or dietary conflicts.

### 4. Tailored Recipe Suggestions

- Analyzes user-provided ingredient lists or images (e.g., pantry items or groceries) and cross-references them with the user’s health profile.
- Recommends creative, personalized recipes that match available ingredients, dietary restrictions, allergies, and nutritional goals.
- Suggests substitutions for missing or allergen-containing ingredients and prioritizes recipes that support health conditions (e.g., low-sodium for hypertension).

### 5. Community and Social Features

- A community hub where users can:
    - Share recipes, food blogs, or meal photos, with options to tag dietary preferences or health benefits.
    - Follow friends or food enthusiasts to exchange personalized recipe ideas.
    - Participate in food-focused challenges (e.g., maintaining a streak of allergy-free or balanced meals).
- Encourages a supportive environment for food lovers to connect and celebrate culinary creativity.

### 6. Explore and Discover

- An exploratory section offering curated content on cuisines, trending recipes, and food cultures, tailored to user preferences and health needs.
- Recommends dishes based on seasonal ingredients, global culinary trends, or personalized goals (e.g., high-protein recipes for muscle gain).
- Includes educational snippets on nutrition, cooking techniques, and ingredient benefits, adjusted for user-specific conditions.

### 7. Innovative AI-Driven Features

- **Personalized Meal Planning**: Generates weekly meal plans based on user health profiles, nutritional needs, and available ingredients.
- **Dietary Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts recipes to accommodate dietary restrictions, allergies, or health conditions.
- **Sentiment-Based Suggestions**: Detects user mood from chat inputs (e.g., “I’m feeling tired”) to suggest energizing or comforting recipes that align with health needs.
- **Virtual Cooking Companion**: Guides users through recipes step-by-step via chat, offering personalized tips (e.g., “Use less oil for your low-fat goal”).
- **Waste Reduction Mode**: Suggests recipes to use up near-expiry ingredients, ensuring compatibility with user allergies and preferences.

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack

    - **React**: For a dynamic, responsive web and mobile application.
    - **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, customizable styling.
    - **Headless UI**: For accessible, unstyled UI components.
    - **Shadcn UI**: For pre-built, customizable UI components to enhance user experience.
- **Backend**:
    - **FastAPI**: For a high-performance, asynchronous API framework with automatic Swagger documentation.
    - **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage, managing user profiles, health data, food diaries, and community content.
    - **Qdrant**: For vector search and storage, enabling efficient similarity searches in multimodal RAG.
- **AI and Machine Learning**:
    - **LangChain**: For orchestrating conversational AI and integrating with language models.
        - **Models**: Gemini-2.0-flash and 4.1-mini for cost-efficient, high-performance NLP and multimodal tasks.
    - **Multimodal RAG**: Combines text and image data for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation, enabling ingredient detection and personalized recipe suggestions.
    - **Computer Vision**: Models like YOLO or ResNet for ingredient detection in images.
    - **NLP**: BERT-based models for processing text inputs and extracting nutritional data, enriched with user context.
- **APIs and Integrations**:
    - Nutrition databases (e.g., USDA FoodData Central, Indian Food Composition Table) for accurate calorie and nutrient information tailored to user needs.
    - Swagger API documentation for clear, interactive API endpoints.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS or Google Cloud for hosting, storage, and AI model deployment.

### Development Considerations
