Below is a streamlined implementation of the **BiteWise AI Assistant** agent using **LangChain**, focusing on the core AI functionality: processing text and base64-encoded image inputs, classifying user intent, executing tools, and generating personalized responses with an OpenAI API key. All database interactions are mocked (assumed handled elsewhere), and no database or caching libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Redis) are used. The agent includes routing, simplified tools (Log Intake, Search Recipes, Calculate Metric), and response generation, keeping things minimal and testable.

### Assumptions
- **OpenAI API Key**: Provided via environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Database**: Mocked; user context, messages, and tool outputs use dummy data.
- **Image Processing**: Mocked; base64 images are validated, assumed to yield a dish name (e.g., "pizza").
- **Tools**: Simplified versions of Log Intake, Search Recipes, and Calculate Metric with mock outputs.
- **LangChain**: Uses `langchain-openai` for LLM integration and `langchain` for prompts, tools, and chains.

### Prerequisites
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv
```

Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
