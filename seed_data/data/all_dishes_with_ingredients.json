      "Heat to melt, about 60 seconds.",
      "Stuff the turkey lightly with your desired stuffing; do not pack it in. This size bird will accommodate about 7 cups total. If there is skin to pull together to cover the stuffing, secure it with skewers. If this skin has been trimmed off, cover the exposed stuffing with foil.",

      "Place the pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven to roast. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes with the thyme butter.",
      "After 1 hour, flip the turkey onto its back for the remaining cooking time. If any areas start to darken too quickly, cover lightly with foil. Continue to baste every 30 minutes. If the pan dries out, add additional stock or water. Never let the pan become dry.",

      "Remove the turkey from the pan and place it on a carving board. Tent the turkey loosely with foil and let rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. This gives you plenty of time to make the pan gravy."

      "Saute the bacon in a large stockpot.Cook until lightly browned but not burned.",
      "Add the onion, stirring well to coat in bacon drippings.",
      "Saute for 7-8 minutes over medium-high heat, until onion is soft and translucent.",
      "Add garlic, carrots, and celery, mixing well with onion, and saute for 10 minutes until tender.",
      "Add can of tomatoes, juice and all.Bring to a simmer and then add the chicken stock.",
      "Add salt and pepper.Bring to a boil and add the pasta (be sure to break the linguine into 2-inch-long pieces).Cook for about 10-12 minutes, until pasta is \"al dente\", the Italian expression for cooked pasta that is still firm, but not hard.Stir the pot frequently as there will not be an abundance of liquid in which to cook the pasta.Alternatively, you could cook the pasta in a separate pot of boiling water, drain it, and add to  the carrot/celery/chicken stock sauce.  But the pasta won't absorb all of the yummy flavors that way.)Taste the sauce, and add more salt and pepper if necessary.About the time the pasta is al dente, you will be left with a lovely sauce in the pot.  (If it is too runny and soupy, continue to cook a bit longer.)",

For $2.75 per serving, this recipe covers 19% of your daily requirements of vitamins and minerals. One portion of this dish contains around 16g of protein, 38g of fat, and a total of 753 calories. Not a lot of people made this recipe, and 4 would say it hit the spot. A mixture of olive oil, baking powder, coconut flour, and a handful of other ingredients are all it t",
    "cuisine": "International",
    "cooking_steps": [
      "Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water.  After about 3 minutes, checks on the blueberries  once juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well.  Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally.  The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot.  If youre looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan.  This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm.While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter.  In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together.",
      "Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and youre left with a very thick batter.  If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes.",
      "Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet.  Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about a third of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet.  Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape.  (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch.",
      "Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.)Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes. Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to break coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe).  Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat.Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioners sugar. If you are looking for more sweetness: drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes."

      "Earlier this week I made two batches, one for us and one for my neighbor to try.  I kept them in a ziplock bag on the counter overnight.  These were for our \"brinner\" (breakfast for dinner) on Tuesday night so could heat up something quickly when we returned home from swim class.  Still just as tasty - my boys devoured all 18 between the two of them that night.   ",

      "Once the dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bowl and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces. ",
      "Ok, real quick, let’s make the garlic butter. This will only take 3 minutes! Over low heat, in a cast iron skillet, melt 5 Tbsp butter. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and saute for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.",
      "Then, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter/garlic mixture through a sieve into a bowl, so separate the garlic from the butter. Alternatively, if you want to leave the garlic pieces in there for a bit of an extra bite on top of your bread, go right ahead!",
      "Alright, back to the naan bread! Now crank up that same cast iron skillet up to medium-high heat…you want it quite hot!",
      "Lightly dust your working surface with flour (not too much!) and roll out each piece to about 1/8″ thin. It’s important to roll out the dough immediately before cooking, or it may not develop those characteristic bubbles while cooking.",
      "Once the skillet is hot, place one of the rolled out dough pieces into the pan. You should see bubbles forming pretty quickly…this is definitely a good thing!After about 1 minute, using a spatula, take a peek on the bottom side of the bread. If it’s browning, flip it over and cook for another 1 minute.",
      "Repeat the above step for all 8 pieces of rolled-out dough.",
      "Finally, remove your cooked naan bread from the skillet and brush with garlic butter, then top with your favorite herbs.",
      "Serve warm and enjoy!"

I just knead it right in the bowl.  Stop kneading as soon as the dough comes together and is soft and not too stickydo not over knead!  Try to knead it no more than 10 times if that helps.Form a ball, place it in the center of the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.After 20 minutes the dough wont really look any different, dont worry about it.  Divide the dough into 8 sections and roll into balls.Re-cover the balls with the plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.On a floured surface roll the balls out, either in a round or oval shape.  Meanwhile heat an iron skillet (or just plain skillet if thats all you have) on medium-high heat.Whack the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cover with a lid.  In less than the time you can roll out another ball the first side will be done, check the bread, when its nice and bubbly on the raw side flip it over and cook for a few more seconds.Thats it, get it out of the pan and put it on a plate or in your mouth or whatever! yum!"
